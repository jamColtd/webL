Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) is a non traditional machining and electro thermal process in which material from the workpiece is removed by using electrical discharges (sparks). In EDM machine the material is removed by rapidly recurring (repeating) discharges of current in between the electrodes. The electrodes are separated by dielectric liquid and a high voltage is applied across it. It is used to machine those materials which are difficult to machine and have high strength temperature resistance. EDM can be used to machine only electrically conductive materials. Otherwise it cannot be used. One of the electrodes is called as tool and other is called as workpiece. Here the tool is connected with the negative terminal of the power supply and the workpiece is connected with the positive terminal. While the definition may seem simplistic, the physical process is a little bit more complex. The removal of material from a workpiece using EDM occurs through a series of recurring rapid current discharges between electrodes. These electrodes are separated using a dielectric fluid. Then, a voltage is sent through the dielectric fluid. It is important to note that EDM manufacturing only works for electrically conductive materials."})]})]}),a("div",{className:i["EDM-box"],children:[a("div",{className:i["PG-label"],children:[e("p",{children:e("span",{className:i["EDM-label-title"],children:"PG(Optical curve grinders)"})}),e("p",{style:{color:"gray"},children:"Optical curve grinders are used to grind precise and complex surfaces, including straight lines, arcs, and curves that reflect the shape of the curve through the refraction of light.

Instead of cutting the material, EDM melts or vaporizes it, leaving little debris and providing a very accurate line. In tool and mould making, EDM is very popular due to its applicability especially for hard materials like titanium or for particularly complex shapes that are hard to achieve with milling. Why Use EDM? In practical terms, electrical discharge machining overcomes a major issue found in contact machining: hardness. In traditional processes, metal workpieces are made from special grades of hardenable tool steels machined in an anneal of soft state to facilitate cutting. One the desired shape has been machined, the parts are then hardened by one or more heat treatments. This adds time, cost and can alter the finished parts\u2019 dimensions, especially if the heat treatment process is not properly controlled. The advantage of EDM is that it can cut hardened materials and exotic alloys while also providing excellent surface finishes as a bonus. The result is often a reduced need for post-processing or surface treatment."})]})]}),a("div",{className:i["EDM-box"],children:[a("div",{className:i["PG-label"],children:[e("p",{children:e("span",{className:i["EDM-label-title"],children:"GR"})}),e("p",{style:{color:"gray"},children:"A grinder (grinder, grinding machine) is a machine tool that uses an abrasive tool to grind the surface of a workpiece.

In short, CNC machining is a metal fabrication method where written code controls the machinery in the manufacturing process. The code determines everything from the movement of the cutting head and the part to spindle speed, RPMs, etc. Contemporary CNC machines are fully automated. All they need is digital files with the instructions about cutting trajectories and tooling. Design or machining processes require many tools to produce a certain part. Machinists can build digital tool libraries that interface with the physical machine. Such machinery can automatically switch tooling based on the digital instructions, making them manufacturing workhorses. The CNC machining process starts with designing the parts in CAD software. The 3D model determines the necessary dimensions and properties of the final part."})]})]})]})}export{L as default};
